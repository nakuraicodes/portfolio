# Nakurai Codes

Here is another experiment with Web Component. The whole website is an SPA but without using any frameworks! I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was straightforward and I liked it a lot. I can't wait to play around more with web components.
The live version is here: [Nakurai Codes](https://nakuraicodes.com).

### application router

I am pretty happy with this bit. Checkout the file `src/js/router.js`. I have a page id per page, and the router monitor changes in the URL's hashes. I find it quite useful and elegant so far.

### deploy note

This website is hosted on Firebase, so the deploy script in the `package.json` file is only working if you have a firebase setup on your computer. Also, I have not submitted some files used for my resume etc.
